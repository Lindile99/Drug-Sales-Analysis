# 💊 Pharmaceutical Drug Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing pharmaceutical sales data to uncover trends in revenue, units sold, customer behqvior and regional performance.
  
We combine **SQL (MySQL Workbench** for querying and data extraction and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)** for analysis, visualization and forecasting.

---

## 🔑 Objectives

-Use **SQL queries** to prepare datasets for analysis.  
-Analyze revenue across different **regions, drug manufacturers and customer segments** to identify high-performing areas.
-Identify **top-selling drugs** and their sales trends over time.
-Explore **monthly sales** patterns to inform marketing strategies.
-**Forecast revenue** for the next 6 months based on historical data.
-Provide visual insights to support decision-making.

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Executed SQL queries in MySQL.  
   - Exported results as CSV files.  
   - Imported into Python for visualization & analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Revenue by drug, manufacturer, and region  
   - Customer type distribution  
   - Seasonal sales trends  

3. **Forecasting**  
   - Applied linear regression on monthly revenue.  
   - Forecasted the next 6 months of sales performance.
